Expansion Impact Analysis: Touch N Go Soccer Third Location
Working under Professor Hao Ji at Cal Poly Pomona, I am conducting a data-driven analysis to evaluate the operational and financial impact of opening a third location on Touch N Go Soccer Academy’s existing two facilities. The project will begin with research on prior case studies of small business expansions, specifically examining how adding a third location affected client distribution, scheduling efficiency, and resource allocation.

I am currently enrolled in my first Machine Learning and Data Mining courses, and as I progress, I will be implementing newly acquired skills from coursework into this project — applying machine learning and data science methods to forecast trends, model business outcomes, and provide actionable insights.

This project/repository will be continuously updated over time to reflect new findings, methodologies, and applied knowledge, serving as both a practical business analysis and a demonstration of my growth in data science.
